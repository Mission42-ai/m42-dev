# ===== PARALLEL EXECUTION STRATEGY =====
parallel_execution:
  max_concurrent_milestones: 3
  coordination:
    - "M1 must complete first (foundation)"
    - "M2 and M4 can run in parallel after M1"
    - "M3 depends on M2"
    - "M5 can start with M1 and continue throughout"
  
  suggested_assignment:
    - agent_1: ["M1", "M2", "M3"]  # Main registration flow
    - agent_2: ["M4"]              # Email infrastructure
    - agent_3: ["M5"]              # Security and testing

# ===== GLOBAL DEFINITION OF DONE =====
global_definition_of_done:
  - "All milestones completed"
  - "End-to-end registration flow tested"
  - "Security scan passed (no critical vulnerabilities)"
  - "Performance benchmarks met"
  - "API documentation complete"
  - "Monitoring and alerts configured"
