# ===== FEATURE OVERVIEW =====
feature:
  id: "FEAT-001-MCP-Server-Support"
  name: "MCP Server for M42-Dev"
  version: "1.0.0"
  owner: "@m42-dev-team"
  target_release: "v2.0.0"
  
  description: |
    Create an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that exposes m42-dev functionality
    as tools that Claude Code can use. This allows Claude to orchestrate autonomous
    development workflows by calling m42-dev commands through the MCP protocol,
    enabling meta-development scenarios where Claude can manage its own feature
    development pipeline.
  
  business_value:
    - "Enables Claude to autonomously manage feature development workflows"
    - "Allows Claude to init features, start milestones, and check status programmatically"
    - "Supports meta-development where Claude can improve m42-dev itself"
    - "Creates a foundation for AI-driven DevOps and project management"

# ===== PARALLEL EXECUTION STRATEGY =====
parallel_execution:
  max_concurrent_milestones: 2
  coordination:
    - "M1 must complete before M2, M3, M4, M5"
    - "M2 must complete before M3"
    - "M3 must complete before M4"
    - "M5 can run parallel to M4 after M3"
