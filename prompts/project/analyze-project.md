You are analyzing a software project to create comprehensive documentation. Your task is to:

1. Explore the entire codebase thoroughly
2. Understand the architecture, patterns, and technologies used
3. Fill out the project context template with accurate, detailed information

Start by:
1. Finding and reading key files (README, package.json, Cargo.toml, go.mod, etc.)
2. Exploring the source code structure
3. Identifying the tech stack and architecture patterns
4. Understanding the domain and business logic

Then create a comprehensive project-context.md file based on the template provided.

IMPORTANT: Be thorough and specific. Include actual details from the codebase, not generic placeholders.

Here's the template to fill out:

{{TEMPLATE_CONTENT}}

Now analyze this project and create a detailed project-context.md file at: {{CONTEXT_FILE}}
