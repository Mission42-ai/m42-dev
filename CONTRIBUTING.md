4. Suggest improvements to error messages

### Documentation Contributions

Good documentation is crucial:
1. Fix typos and clarify confusing sections
2. Add examples for complex features
3. Translate documentation
4. Create video tutorials or blog posts

## Development Practices

### Bash Script Guidelines

```bash
# Use set -e for error handling
set -e

# Quote variables
echo "Processing: ${FEATURE_ID}"

# Use functions for reusability
validate_feature_id() {
    local feature_id="$1"
    [[ "$feature_id" =~ ^FEAT-[0-9]+ ]] || return 1
}

# Add helpful error messages
if ! validate_feature_id "$FEATURE_ID"; then
    echo "Error: Invalid feature ID format. Expected: FEAT-XXX" >&2
    exit 1
fi
```

### YAML Structure

```yaml
# Use clear, consistent structure
feature:
  id: "FEAT-XXX"          # Always quote IDs
  name: "Clear Name"      # Descriptive names
  
milestones:
  - id: "M1"
    name: "Milestone Name"
    # Group related items
    implementation_checklist:
      category:
        "Task description": "status"
```

### Error Handling

1. **Validate inputs** early
2. **Provide helpful error messages**
3. **Handle edge cases gracefully**
4. **Log errors appropriately**

## Release Process

1. **Version numbering**: Semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)
2. **Changelog**: Update CHANGELOG.md with all changes
3. **Testing**: Full test suite must pass
4. **Documentation**: Ensure docs are up-to-date
